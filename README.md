## Data Source

### Bigfoot Data
A database of Bigfoot sightings was constructed using the summaries of data from [The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO)](www.bfro.net) elaborated by [Mangani's Bigfoot Maps](http://penn.freeservers.com/bigfootmaps/). From the latter's website, I downloaded the
[text file](http://www.penn.freeservers.com/bigfootmaps/BFROcreature.txt) containing the 2016 updated BFRO's creature sightings. I converted the text file into a CSV file and edited it using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I organized the attribute data file to contain latitude, longitude, date of the Bigfoot sighting, and a link to BFRO's report of each record (see Fig. 1).
