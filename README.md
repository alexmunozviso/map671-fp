## Project Introduction
For the final project of MAP671, I wanted to create a map representing curious data. Looking for different themes, I stumbled upon [The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO)](http://www.bfro.net), a website compiling different databases of Bigfoot encounters including sightings, audible sightings, trackmarks, or footprints. Every report included in these databases is geocoded and timestamped. 

Although I am not the 'I believe' type or into conspiracy theories, I thought it could be fun to map this data. Moreover, the BFRO accepts online submissions of Bigfoot sighting reports, which adds a certain sense of community data crowdsourcing and community mapping to the project; two research topics that are of great personal interest.

## Data Sources

### Bigfoot Sightings Data
My database of Bigfoot sightings was constructed using the summaries of data from [The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO)](http://www.bfro.net) elaborated by [Mangani's Bigfoot Maps](http://penn.freeservers.com/bigfootmaps/). From the latter's website, I downloaded a
[text file](http://www.penn.freeservers.com/bigfootmaps/BFROcreature.txt) containing the 2016 updated BFRO's creature sightings. This data includes only visual sightings of the Bigfoot and excludes records of audible sightings, trackmarks, or footprints. I converted the text file into a CSV file and edited it using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I re-organized and arranged the attribute data file to keep contain latitude, longitude, date of the sighting, and a link to the BFRO's sighting report (see Fig. 1 & 2). My final CSV file contained 3209 geocoded and timestamped reports for the North American area. After clipping the database to the extent of the contiguous United States in QGIS, 3032 reports remained on my final database.

Here you can download the prime CSV file and the final version of the database as a GeoJSON:

### Other Data
2022 United States county and state boundaries were obtained from the [United States Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html). After adding geometries, **joining the Bigfoot sightings database per location**, and normalizing this data per state/county area, these are the final datasets:
* DATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA state LINK
* DATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA county LINK

## Tools Used
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) was used to create the Bigfoot Sighting Database.
* [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) was used to geoprocess, analyze, and represent the geodata for this project.
* Data is shown on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) web map. If the map got popular it would require a fee to use.
* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator) was used to edit the Bigfoot miniatures used for both the webmap and this site header.
