        <h1>Mapping Bigfoot Sightings in the Contiguous United States</h1>
        <h2>Àlex Muñoz Viso (he/him/his), MAP671 Final Project</h2>
        
                <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    For the final project of MAP671, I wanted to create a map representing 
                    curious data. Looking for different themes, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.bfro.net">The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO)</a>, a website compiling 
                    different databases of Bigfoot encounters including sightings, audible sightings, trackmarks, or footprints. Every report included in these databases is 
                    geocoded and timestamped. </p>

                <p> 
                    Although I am not the 'I believe' type or really interested in conspiracy theories (more like in conspiracy theorists), I thought it could be fun to map this data. Moreover, the BFRO accepts online submissions 
                    of Bigfoot sighting reports, which adds a certain sense of community data crowdsourcing and community mapping to their project; two research topics that are of great 
                    personal interest.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Sources</h3>
                <p>
                    I built my <b>Bigfoot sightings database</b> using the 2016 updated creature sighting data from the <a href="http://www.bfro.net">BFRO</a> 
                    summarized by <a href="http://penn.freeservers.com/bigfootmaps">Mangani's Bigfoot Maps</a>. The <b>2022 United States county and state boundaries</b> were obtained from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary">United States Census Bureau website</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Sources</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bigfoot miniature used all over this project is a slightly modified version of a vector downladed from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">Freepik</a>.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Tools used in this project</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> was used to create the Bigfoot Sighting Database.
                    <li><a href="https://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> was used to geoprocess, analyze, and represent the geodata for this project.</li>
                    <li>Data is shown on <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> web map. If the map got popular it would require a fee to use.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a> was used to edit the Bigfoot vector serving both as the webmap's symbol and this site's header.</li>
                </ul>
                        
                </p>
                <h3>Project Static Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    Aside from the webmap available at the top of this page, I built three static maps for this project. They are designed to be presented together as each 
                    map offers distinct nuances from the same data.
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Bigfoot Sightings by State">Bigfoot Sightings by State</a><br /></li>
                        <li><a href="#Bigfoot Sightings by County">Bigfoot Sightings by County area</a><br /></li>
                        <li><a href="#Bigfoot Sighting Reports (1900-2016)">Bigfoot Sighting Reports (1900-2016)</a><br /></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h4><a id="Bigfoot Sightings by State">Bigfoot Sightings by State</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The first map represents Bigfoot sightings from 1900 to 2016 per state as a choropleth map. The values were not normalized because I wanted to provide 
                    a first map that could be read easily. The District of Columbia is the only state with zero sightings. Because of its small size, it cannot be seen as a sole 
                    record so, I decided include in a single category all the states with zero to twenty-five reports. 
                </p>

                    title="Bigfoot Sightings by State"> 
                    <div class="linkbox">You can access a high resolution 1200dpi version of this map <a href="https://github.com/alexmunozviso/map671-fp/blob/main/maps/map1-states1200dpi.png">here</a>.</div>

                <h4><a id="Bigfoot Sightings by County">Bigfoot Sightings by County area</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The second map represents Bigfoot sightings per county. Instead of visualizing the total number of reports in each county, I opted for showing a normalized
                    measure, as it represents geography in a more faithful way, accounting for each countiy's size. Because the three maps are designed to be displayed together, 
                    this second map is not aiming at offering a clear information graphic (as the first map did) but a more nuanced picture than that of the first map.

                <h4><a id="Bigfoot Sighting Reports (1900-2016)">Bigfoot Sighting Reports (1900-2016)</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The third map represents all Bigfoot sighting reports in my database as single symbols in a map of the contiguous United States. I wanted to include this map
                    because I think it is the one that offers the information in a more visually striking way. Seen together with the other maps, one can better understand sightening 
                    clusterings and start asking interesting geographical questions.
                </p>

                    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a playful way of reviewing and applying many of the topics, tools, and processes learned during the course. Moreover, the topic I chose allows for 
                    very interesting reflections on the nature of data, the relationship between data and truth, or online data and mapping communities. Overall, I am happy with 
                    the results of this project and I am really looking forward to continue the learning process next semester in MAP672.
                </p>
